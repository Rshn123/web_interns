            <h1>Private and secure <br> messaging</h1>
            <p>All around the world, users turn to Viber to have open and authentic 
                <br> conversations with their friends, family and colleagues. With Viber 
                <br>you can rest assured, knowing that your personal chats are always 
                <br>protected and private and that all your conversations are your own. 
                <br>Our mission is to protect that privacy so you never have to think 
                <br> twice about what you can or can't share when you're using Viber.
            </p>

                <h3>We don't read or listen to any <br> of your chats and calls</h3>
                <p>Unlike some other messaging apps, Viber 
                    <br> can't read your personal chats (one-on-one 
                    <br> chats and group chats) or listen in on your 
                    <br> one-on-one audio or video calls. We use 
                    <br> end-to-end encryption by default, so no 
                    <br> need to go out of your way to turn it on. 
                    <br> Your private and group communications 
                    <br> are completely safe so that only you and 
                    <br> the people you're talking to can read or 
                    <br>hear them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>We can't and don't sell what <br> you share</h3>
                <p>When your chats are protected by end-to-
                    <br> end encryption, no one can access them. 
                    <br> Perhaps most importantly, Viber doesn't 
                    <br> have access to them‚Äîwhich means 
                    <br> nothing you share can be used by Viber or 
                    <br> 3rd parties to target you with ads later. 
                    <br> Some other messaging apps don't offer 
                    <br> end-to-end encryption by default‚Äîhence 
                    <br> they can access, read, and sell your private 
                    <br> conversations to others for advertising 
                    <br> purposes.

            <div>
                <h3>More than encryption</h3>
                <p>Not only are your communications 
                    <br> protected by end-to-end encryption by 
                    <br> default, but nothing you share is ever 
                    <br> stored on Viber's servers once 
                    <br> delivered. Messages you send make their 
                    <br> way from your device to the recipient as 
                    <br> an encrypted code. If the recipient's phone 
                    <br> is off or they don't have an internet 
                    <br> connection‚Äîyour message will wait 
                    <br> patiently on Viber's servers for a limited 
                    <br> time only‚Äîstill safe and encrypted‚Äîuntil 
                    <br> their device is set to receive and decrypt it.

                <h3>End-to-end encryption by default</h3>
                <p>Messages you send make their way from your device
                    <br> to the recipient's in the form of an encrypted code 
                    <br> that only their device can translate to plain text using 
                    <br> an encryption key.
                </p>
                <p>Encryption keys exist only on user devices and 
                    <br> nowhere else. So no one‚Äînot even Viber‚Äîcan read
